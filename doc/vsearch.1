.SH DESCRIPTION
Environmental or clinical molecular studies generate large volumes of
amplicons (e.g. SSU-rRNA sequences) that need to be filtered,
dereplicated, searched, clustered or compared to sequences from other
studies. The aim of \fBvsearch\fR is to offer a all-in-one open source
tool to perform these tasks, using optimized algorithm implementations
and harvesting the full potential of modern computers to guarantee a
fast and accurate data processing.
.PP
Nucleotidic sequence comparisons is at the core of \fBvsearch\fR. To
speed up comparisons, \fBvsearch\fR implements an efficient
\fIk\fR-mer filtering, and an extremely fast Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm making use of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE2) of modern
x86-64 CPUs. If SSE2 instructions are not available, \fBvsearch\fR
exits with an error message.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Input
\fBvsearch\fR input is a fasta file containing one or several
nucleotidic sequences. For each sequence, the sequence identifier is
defined as the string comprised between the ">" symbol and the first
space or the end of the line, whichever comes first. Additionally, if
the line ends with the pattern ";size=\fIinteger\fR;", \fBvsearch\fR
will interpret \fIinteger\fR as the abundance of the sequence (in a
dereplicated fasta file for instance). The nucleotidic sequence is
defined as a string of [acgt] or [acgu] symbols (case insensitive),
starting after the end of the identifier line and ending before the
next identifier line or the file end; \fBvsearch\fR exits with an
error message if any other symbol is present in the
sequence. Optionally, \fBvsearch\fR can be compiled to accepted
compressed fasta files as input (gz and bzip2 formats).
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Options
\fBvsearch\fR recognizes a large number of command-line options. For
an easier navigation, options are grouped by theme (dereplication,
filtering, sorting, searching, comparison, clustering). We start with
general options that apply to all themes.
.PP
General options:
.RS
.TP 9
.B --help
display a short help and exit.
.TP
.B --version
output version information and exit.
.TP
.BI --fasta_width\~ "positive integer"
fasta files produced by \fBvsearch\fR are wrapped (sequences written
on lines of \fIinteger\fR nucleotides, 80 by default). Set that value
to 0 to eliminate the wrapping.
.TP
.BI --maxseqlength\~ "positive integer"
all \fBvsearch\fR operations will discard sequences of length equal or
greater than \fIinteger\fR (50,000 nucleotides by default).
.TP
.BI --minseqlength\~ "positive integer"
all \fBvsearch\fR operations will discard sequences of length smaller
than \fIinteger\fR (1 nucleotide by default for sorting or shuffling,
32 nucleotides for dereplication, clustering or searching).
.TP
.B --notrunclabels
do not truncate sequence labels at first space, use the full header.
.TP
.BI --strand\~ "plus|both"
when searching or dereplicating, check the \fIplus\fR strand only
(default) or check \fIboth\fR strands.
.TP
.BI --threads\~ "positive integer"
number of computation threads to use. The number of threads should be
lesser or equal to the number of available CPU cores. The default is to 
launch one thread per available logical core.
.TP
.BI --uc \0filename
when searching, clustering or dereplicating, output results in
\fIfilename\fR using a uclust-like format.
.TP
.B --uc_allhits
when searching, clustering or dereplicating, and when using the --uc
option, show all hits, not just top hit.
.RE

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clustering options:
.RS
.TP 9
.BI --centroids \0filename
output cluster centroid sequences to \fIfilename\fR file.
.TP
.BI --cluster_fast \0filename
use the fast clustering algorithm and write the results to
\fIfilename\fR.
.TP
.BI --cluster_smallmem \0filename
use a slower clustering algorithm (consumes less memory) and write the
results to \fIfilename\fR.
.TP
.BI --clusters \0string
output each cluster to a separate fasta file using the prefix
\fIstring\fR and a ticker (0, 1, 2, etc.) to construct the filenames.
.TP
.\" .BI --consout \0filename
.\" output cluster consensus sequences to \fIfilename\fR. For each
.\" cluster, a multiple alignment is computed, and a consensus sequence is
.\" constructed by taking the majority symbol (nucleotide or gap) from
.\" each column of the alignment. Columns containing a majority of gaps
.\" are skipped, except for terminal gaps. Use --construncate to take
.\" terminal gaps into account.
.\" .TP
.\" .B --construncate
.\" when using the --consout option to build consensus sequences, do not
.\" ignore terminal gaps. That option skips terminal columns if they
.\" contain a majority of gaps, yielding shorter consensus sequences than
.\" when using --consout alone.
.\" .TP
.\" .BI --msaout \0filename
.\" output multiple sequence alignments of each cluster to \fIfilename\fR.
.\" .TP
.B --usersort
when using --cluster_smallmem, conserve the initial input order of

.TP
.BI --db \0filename
compare query sequences to the fasta-formatted subject sequences
contained in \fIfilename\fR, using global pairwise alignment.
.TP
.BI --dbmask\~ "none|dust|soft"
mask simple repeats and low-complexity regions in subject database
sequences using the \fIdust\fR or the \fIsoft\fR algorithms, or do not
mask (\fInone\fR). The default is to mask using \fIdust\fR.
.TP
.BI --dbmatched \0filename
write database subject sequences matching at least one query sequence
to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.BI --dbnotmatched \0filename
write database subject sequences not matching query sequences to

.TP
.BI --fastapairs \0filename
write pairwise alignments of query and subject sequences to
\fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.B --fulldp
dummy option. To maximize search sensitivity, vsearch uses a 8-way
SIMD vectorized full dynamic programming algorithm (Needleman-Wunsch),
whether or not --fulldp is specified.
.TP
.BI --gapext \0string
penalties for gap extension (2I/1E)
.TP
.BI --gapopen \0string
penalties for gap opening (20I/2E)

.BI --id \0real
reject the sequence match if the pairwise identity is lower than
\fIreal\fR (value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 included). \fB(what is the
formula?)\fR
.TP
.BI --idprefix\~ "positive integer"
reject the subject sequence if the first \fIinteger\fR nucleotides do
not match the query sequence.
.TP
.BI --idsuffix\~ "positive integer"
reject the subject sequence if the last \fIinteger\fR nucleotides do
not match the query sequence.
.TP
.B --leftjust
reject the subject sequence if the alignment begins with gaps.
.TP
.BI --match\~ "integer"
score assigned to a match (i.e. identical nucleotides) in the pairwise
alignment. The default value is 2.

.BI --matched \0filename
write query sequences matching database subject sequences to
\fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.BI --maxaccepts\~ "positive integer"
maximum number of hits to accept before stopping the search. The
default value is 1. That option works in pair with maxrejects. The
search process sorts subject sequences by decreasing number of kmers
they have in common with the query sequence, using that information as
a proxy for sequence similarity. If the first subject sequence passes
the acceptation criteria, it is accepted as best hit and the search
process stops for that query. If maxaccepts is set to a higher value,
more hits are accepted. If maxaccepts and maxrejects are both set to
0, the complete database is searched.
.TP
.BI --maxdiffs\~ "positive integer"
reject the subject sequence if the alignment contains at least
\fIinteger\fR substitutions, insertions or deletions.
.TP
.BI --maxgaps\~ "positive integer"
reject the subject sequence if the alignment contains at least
\fIinteger\fR insertions or deletions.
.TP

reject query sequences with an abundance equal or greater than
\fIinteger\fR.
.TP
.BI --maxqt \0real
reject if the query/subject length ratio is equal or greater than
\fIreal\fR.
.TP
.BI --maxrejects\~ "positive integer"
maximum number of non-matching subject sequences to consider before
stopping the search. The default value is 32. That option works in
pair with maxaccepts. The search process sorts subject sequences by
decreasing number of kmers they have in common with the query
sequence, using that information as a proxy for sequence
similarity. If none of the first 32 subject sequences pass the
acceptation criteria, the search process stops for that query (no
hit). If maxrejects is set to a higher value, more subject sequences
are considered. If maxaccepts and maxrejects are both set to 0, the
complete database is searched.
.TP
.BI --maxsizeratio \0real
reject if the query/subject abundance ratio is equal or greater than
\fIreal\fR.

.BI --mintsize\~ "positive integer"
reject subject sequences with an abundance lower than \fIinteger\fR.
.TP
.BI --mismatch\~ "integer"
score assigned to a mismatch (i.e. different nucleotides) in the
pairwise alignment. The default value is -4.
.TP
.BI --notmatched \0filename
write query sequences not matching database subject sequences to
\fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.B --output_no_hits
write both matching and non-matching queries to output files
(--alnout, --blast6out, and --userout. Output files --uc and
--uc_allhits always feature non-matching queries). Non-matching
queries are labelled "no hit" in --alnout files \fB(to be
verified)\fR.
.TP
.BI --qmask\~ "none|dust|soft"
mask simple repeats and low-complexity regions in query sequences
using the \fIdust\fR or the \fIsoft\fR algorithms, or do not mask
(\fInone\fR). The default is to mask using \fIdust\fR.
.TP
.BI --query_cov \0real
reject if the fraction of the query aligned to the subject sequence is
lower than \fIreal\fR.
.TP
.B --rightjust
reject the subject sequence if the alignment ends with gaps.
.TP
.BI --rowlen\~ "positive integer"
width of alignment lines in alnout output. The default value is
64. Set that value to 0 to eliminate the wrapping.
.TP
.B --self
reject the alignment if the query and subject labels are identical.
.TP
.B --selfid
reject the alignment if the query and subject sequences are identical.
.TP
.BI --target_cov \0real
reject if the fraction of the subject sequence aligned to the query
sequence is lower than \fIreal\fR.
.TP
.B --top_hits_only
output only the hits with the highest percentage of identity with the
query.
.TP
.BI --userfields \0string
when using --userout, select and order the fields written to the
output file. See the next section for a complete list of fields.
.TP
.BI --userout \0filename
write user-defined tab-separated output to \fIfilename\fR. See
"userfields".
.TP
.BI --vsearch_global \0filename
\fIfilename\fR of queries for global alignment search.
.TP
.BI --weak_id \0real
show hits with percentage of identity of at least \fIreal\fR, without
terminating the search. A normal search stops as soon as enough hits
are found (as defined by --maxaccepts, --maxrejects, and --id). As
--weak_id reports weak hits that are not deduced from --maxaccepts,
high --id values can be used, hence preserving both speed and
sensitivity. Logically, \fIreal\fR must be smaller than the value
indicated by --id.
.TP
.BI --wordlength\~ "positive integer"
length of words (i.e. \fIk\fRmers) for database index. The default
value is 8.

.SH DELIBERATE CHANGES
If you are a usearch user, our objective is to make you feel at
home. That's why vsearch was designed to behave like usearch, to some
extend. Like any complex software, usearch is not free from quirks and
inconsistencies. We decided not to reproduce some of them, and for
complete transparency, to document here the deliberate changes we
made.

During a search with usearch, when using the options --blast6out and
--output_no_hits, for queries with no match the number of fields
reported is 13, where it should be 12. vsearch outputs 12 fields.
