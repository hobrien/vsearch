# Datasets for testing

AF091148.fsa is a tiny dataset with 180,704 nt in 1,403 seqs, from 103 to 137 nt (avg 129).

BioMarKs.fsa is a larger dataset with 119,117,805 nt in 312,503 seqs, from 2 to 532 nt (avg 381). It is compressed with gzip due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

constaint.fsa.bz2 - fasta file for constraint checking, i.e. special cases such as 2048-long reads that can break the code
